%Professor% I hope you know where you are at the moment, otherwise I think you may have taken the wrong class after all.
%Professor% Arkona is the majestic capital of our country, which shines not only because of its extraordinary architecture...
%Professor% ...but also for the prosperity brought to it by our great port marina...
%Professor% ...which is located directly under the city in the cliff vaults. For any foreign students who have not yet seen it...
%Professor% ...I would strongly advise you to visit it. However, watch your bags! Even though the city guards are trying their best...
%Professor% ...there are some quite skilled thieves who quickly get lost in the crowd.
%Professor% Usually there are also at least as many people at the main landmark of our city - the Bridge of Unity of Arkona! 
%Professor% However, there are currently renovation works going on, so nobody is allowed on the bridge.

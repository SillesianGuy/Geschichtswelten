%Professor% Speaking of important monuments.
%Professor% Between us and Nerpy, on the island of Hornbol, there is a collection of colossal statues of the gods...
%Professor% ...of which only 5 out of 7 Gods remain. Unfortunately, no rock is resistant to the external influences of nature...
%Professor% ...if it is not taken care of regularly. One of the statues, to be precise, the fire God Swarozirk...
%Professor% ...holds a fire in his hand that never seems to go out and is another blessing from the gods. I'm pretty sure...
%Professor% ...that there's a scientific explanation for that too, if you'd ask me, but unfortunately it's not possible...
%Professor% ...to get too close to this island. Again and again people disappear in this area or go mad...
%Professor% ...if they survive the shipwrecks. Everyone usually talks about some God called Wales...
%Professor% ...known to us from ancient lore only as the God of the afterlife and the plagues. If you want my opinion...
%Professor% ...I think that either the rock or something under the surface of the water may form harmful compounds...
%Professor% ...that cause severe damage and hallucinations when inhaled. But I think I've talked too much already!
%Professor% Next week we will dig deeper into the culture of Redaria and deal a little more excessively with Queen Matylda of the Wilds.
%Professor% Thank you for your attention, until next time.

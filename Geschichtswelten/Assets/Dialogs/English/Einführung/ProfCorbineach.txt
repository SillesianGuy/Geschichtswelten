%Professor% You may wonder how it is possible that the nature suddenly has a mind of its own?
%Professor% Well, as the legend goes, a few hundred years ago, a root of the Bog Tree supposedly broke through the soil of Corbineach...

%Professor% The possible access to the island is currently a fishing village, where the headquarters of the druid circle is also located...
%Professor% ...which is supposed to maintain the relationship between the beings and the humans. At its head is the druid elder Mena, the Seer... 
%Professor% ...who lost her sight in the conflict against Redarien, but now sees through the eyes of her raven Sindel.

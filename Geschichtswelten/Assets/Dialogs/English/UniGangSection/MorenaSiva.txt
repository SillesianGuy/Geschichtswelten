%placeholder% When I reentered the corridor, the general's daughters were standing in the hallway.
%Morena% Ah, %placeholder%, we have been looking for you!
%placeholder% Hey, what’s up?
%Siva% We saw Finn burying something here earlier.
%Morena% We wanted to ask if you might know something more? We thought he had stopped with it.
%placeholder% Finn buried something? That explains his dirty hands…
%placeholder% What exactly did he stop doing? Digging holes?
%Morena% Haha... You know, where he helped some dealers hide the goods inconspicuously....
%placeholder% Oh that... Nah, he swore to me at the time that he had stopped doing that... But if I find out more, I'll let you know!
%Siva% Great, see you tomorrow!

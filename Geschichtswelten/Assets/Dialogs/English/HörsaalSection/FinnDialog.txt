3 %Finn% I hope you're better rested than you look. You're lucky the professor didn't catch you sleeping...
%Finn% ...otherwise you'd be the next person he sends to the Fragole district.
%placeholder% Haha... Very funny... What's the deal with the second pair of socks?
%Finn% You don't wanna know...
%Finn% Are you still having the same nightmare?
%placeholder% Yes, somehow it doesn't get any better... But enough about that. What's up? Is our meeting still on? As I understand it, he's expecting a whole five pages by next week and I haven't even started my research yet...
%Finn% That's what I wanted to talk about... I have to cancel today, I have to ... Umm... I promised to help someone with a small thing....
%placeholder% Whom?
0 %Finn% Ahh, you donâ€™t know him.
%placeholder% Is it one of your dealer friends again?
2 %Finn% Why would you think that? I've quit, okay?
0 %placeholder% You're acting suspicious as hell for that.
2 %Finn% I told you, I'm not doing this anymore...
0 %placeholder% Wait a second, why are your hands covered in dirt?
%Finn% Just fell down, it's lucky dirt now. Why do you ask so many damn stupid questions?
%placeholder% Why are you acting so stupid?
1 %Finn% I'm acting stupid? You're accusing me of something all the time!
%placeholder% I'm worried, Finn. The last time...
2 %Finn% We're not going to discuss this now, it's all fine, okay? I have to go now, I'll see you tomorrow.
4 %placeholder% FINN?! ... What in Swarock's Wrath was that?
%placeholder% He's not getting away from me that easily. I should find out what he's up to...
